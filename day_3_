# Example: observed dice rolls (1=success, 0=failure)
# Suppose we roll a dice 10 times, and 4 times it shows 6
successes = 4
trials = 10

# Bayesian model to estimate probability of rolling a 6
with pm.Model() as model:
    # Prior: probability of rolling a 6 is uniform 0-1
    p = pm.Beta("p", alpha=1, beta=1)
    
    # Likelihood: observed dice rolls
    obs = pm.Binomial("obs", n=trials, p=p, observed=successes)
    
    # Sample from posterior
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, cores=1, random_seed=42, progressbar=True)

# Summarize estimated probability
print(az.summary(trace, var_names=["p"]))

# Plot posterior distribution
